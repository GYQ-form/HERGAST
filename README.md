# HERGAST

HERGAST: High-resolution Enhanced Relational Graph Attention Network for Spatial Transcriptomics

This document will help you easily go through the HERGAST model.



## Installation

To install the package, run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GYQ-form/HERGAST.git
cd HERGASAT
pip install .
```


## Usage

HERGAST is an approach for spatial clustering and signal amplification in ultra-large-scale and ultra-high-resolution spatial transcriptomics data. HERGAST employs a heterogeneous graph network that integrates gene expression similarity and spatial proximity, incorporating both local and global spatial relationships
